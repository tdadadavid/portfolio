## Building Minired: A Lightweight Redis Clone

Creating a Redis clone like `minired` forces you to distill complex systems into minimal, understandable components. Redis itself is an in-memory data structure store, which supports a variety of types like strings, hashes, lists, and sets. To start, it's essential to understand how TCP servers work in your language of choice. For example, in Java, you might use a `ServerSocket` to listen for incoming client connections:

```java
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(6379);
Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
```

This sets the stage for your in-memory key-value store. Once a client connects, you can begin parsing commands and mapping them to internal handlers.

## Parsing and Protocol Design

One of the most critical parts of building a Redis clone is command parsing. Redis uses its own protocol called RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol). A sample command from a client might look like this:

```text
*3
$3
SET
$5
hello
$5
world
```

Parsing this into usable commands requires understanding the protocol's structure and writing a robust tokenizer. Don't underestimate this step — it’s where performance can be won or lost.

## Core Storage Logic

With the protocol decoded, we move to the core logic. You'll typically back your key-value store with something like a `ConcurrentHashMap` or a thread-safe dictionary depending on your language. Here's a rough sketch in Java:

```java
Map<String, String> store = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
store.put("hello", "world");
String value = store.get("hello"); // returns "world"
```

You’ll need to implement command handlers for `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, etc., and ensure you have proper error handling and response formatting. Bonus points if you can mirror Redis responses (`+OK\r\n`, `$5\r\nworld\r\n`, etc.).

## Resources, Images, and Extras

If you’re looking to go further, here are some helpful resources:

- [Redis Protocol specification (RESP)](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/)
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](https://dataintensive.net/)
- [How Redis works under the hood](https://redis.io/docs/)

You’ll also want to familiarize yourself with tools and technologies that make development smoother:

1. Docker for containerizing your clone  
2. JMH for benchmarking performance  
3. Wireshark for analyzing protocol behavior  

Here’s a Redis logo just to keep things aesthetic:

And for fun, here are some nice-to-have features you could add:

- ⏳ Key expiration
- 📦 Disk persistence
- 📣 Pub/Sub system
- 🔐 Basic auth
- 🧪 Test coverage using JUnit or similar

> A successful return from write() does not make any guarantee that data has been committed to disk. On some filesystems, including NFS, it does not even guarantee that space has successfully been reserved for the data. In this case, some errors might be delayed until a future write(), fsync(2), or even close(2). The only way to be sure is to call fsync(2) after you are done writing all your data.
