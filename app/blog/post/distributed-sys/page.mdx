# Distributed System

**Distributed systems consist of autonomous computers that work together to give the appearance of a single coherent system.**

## The Problem

Distributed systems, a terminology you might have heard if you've been in tech for while, but what is it about? why do we need to care about it? or is it just one of those
buzz words?

## The Conversation

A while ago I had a conversation with my friend, Davidmark, that will serve as the foundation

```markdown
Davidmark: "why do we need multiple computers to perform several tasks?"
```

```markdown
Me: for better performance
```

```markdown
Davidmark: Why can't we have one computer then increase the capacity in terms of Disk size
and processor speed
```

```markdown
Me: There is a degree to which you increase the computer's dosk and processor and you
won't see any significant change or improvement in performance.
```

```markdown
Davidmark: Why? ü§î
```

```markdown
Me: Hmmmm.... I don't know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```

```markdown
Davidmark: because of Heat!
```

```markdown
Me: ü§Ø
```

This was a gotcha moment for me cause it was really simple, "an increase in hardware brings a direct increase in _Heat_ serving as a fundamental issue for performance".
Now we are in a state of dilema where we need to

-   Efficienty process more tasks
-   Increase disk and processors, yet this does not neccessarily gaurantee performance
-   Increase disk and processors which leads to greater heat generation

## The Question

All these leads us to ask several thoughts provking questions

-   How do we solve the _ever growing tasks_ the computer needs to process with the most optimal computing resources?
-   Can we divide these tasks between different computers?
-   If we can couple different computers, How do we couple unreliable systems to form a reliable system?
-   What are the costs/disadvantages that comes with this decision
-   Should every system be distributed? When should we design a distributed system?
-   What problems need distributed systems? What problems don't need?

## The Conclusion

Looking at all these we can say distributed systems solves critical problems and its a fun field to explore and dig into.
