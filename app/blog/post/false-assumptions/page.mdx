# Why do developers create unneccesarily complex systems?

Peter Deutsch, then at Sun
Microsystems, formulated these mistakes as the following false assumptions that
everyone makes when developing a distributed application for the first time:

1. The network is reliable.
2. The network is secure.
3. The network is homogeneous.
4. The topology does not change.
5. Latency is zero.
6. Bandwidth is infinite.
7. Transport cost is zero.
8. There is one administrator.
